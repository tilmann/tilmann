# Tilmann.README [WIP]

This README is meant as documentation about me, and it might help to start a conversation, communicate better, work together and set expectations. In the future I want to share my values, my goals, my motivations, what I like and hate and how I work. It will be a recommended read for everyone who works with me.

## :100: Motivation

- I am motivated by teams and ownership. I am always impressed what a team can achieve if every team member declares ownership for their responsibilities.
- We are living in exponential times in terms of progress for humanity. But we need to save the planet as a place where we enjoy living together. Therefore, the climate crisis is the most pressing issue to address.

## :speech_balloon: Communication

- "Strong opinions, weakly held" - I will have an opinion, but I will try to listen and learn and if I was wrong I am happy to change my mind about it. [Source](https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/)
- I tend to be loud and outspoken. Sometimes I need help to make sure everyone is heard.
- Don't be too serious. We are here to enjoy. I use irony a lot to highlight that this world takes itself too serious.

## :building_construction: Way of working

- Our actions have a lot of side effects. One action will always influence a lot of systems. Our goals should always try to improve systems and not local maxima.
- Working in new areas is the best way to find out how something works. So I try new things often. If I learn that something does not work out I let it go.

## :game_die: Random

- Language is important. I am trying to use inclusive speech.
- A stoic mindset helps me to be a very happy person. _You have power over your mind — not outside events. (Marcus Aurelius)_
- Life is an infinite game. The goal of finite games is to win. The goal of infinite games is to keep playing.
- I :blue_heart: emojis!
